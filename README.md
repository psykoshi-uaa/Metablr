# Metablr
Automates workflow for reformatting metabolomics excel sheets

### USAGE
Metablr searches the provided xlsx files for headers with specific terms. These terms are exported from CompoundDiscoverer by default. If the program is not working please ensure that you are inputting files that have normalized data and RSD QC's. Please also ensure that you are using two xlsx files before trying to stitch - otherwise no stitch file will be generated.
